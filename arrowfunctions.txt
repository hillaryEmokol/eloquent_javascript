this is a notation for declaring functions.
we have the function name as a variable name followed by the equal sign then, then a list of parameters
in brackets(), the arrow then follows these parameters and precedes the function body.

example: 
let sum = (x, y) => {
return x+y;
}

or 
let square = x => return x*x;
